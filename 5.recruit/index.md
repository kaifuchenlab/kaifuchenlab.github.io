To apply for a position, please send a CV, cover letter or research statement, and information for three references to the PI, Kaifu Chen, PhD (Bchkfc.png).


**Overview:** Outstanding bioinformatics postdoctoral candidates are always welcome to apply for positions in the Chen Lab (https://kaifuchenlab.github.io) at the Boston Children's Hospital in Harvard Medical School. Candidates with rich experiences in multi-omics data analysis at the spatial / single-cell level and a strong background in disciplines such as biology, physics, mathematics, statistics, or computer sciences are highly encouraged to apply. Ideal candidates are highly selfmotivated, creative, independent, excellent in communication skills, and enthusiastic about discussions and sharing. The lab is productive in recent years in both bioinformatics methods development(Nature Communications 2020a, Genome Biology 2020, Science Advances 2022, Molecular Cell 2024, etc.) and biomedical research (Nature 2018, Science 2019, Circulation 2020, Nature Cell Biology 2021, Nature Communications 2023, etc). Postdoc Alumni have been fortunate enough to obtain faculty positions in reknowned Institutes such as the Harvard University, Peking Univeristy, Cornell University, Zhejiang University, Terasaki Institute and industry positions such as IT engineer in the Amazon. Both the School and Hospital offer rich and dynamic research environments. The work location is embraced by tens of other top institutes such as the Massachusetts General Hospital, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and Broad Institute.

**Research Opportunities:** A postdoc in the lab can choose some of the following research directions.

• Analyze high-resolution single-cell RNA-seq, ChIP-seq / Cut&Tag, ATAC-seq, MERFISH, RNA modification profiles, and Hi-C data to unravel spatial and temporal dimensions of biological processes.

• Investigate the regulatory mechanisms of gene expression, including intercellular communication, transcription factors, histone modifications, RNA modifications, and 3D chromatin folding, to gain insights into development and diseases.

• Develop innovative computational tools, statistical methods, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, machine learning algorithms, or network models.

• Collaborate with clinicians and biologists to enhance research productivity, foster innovation, and facilitate translational applications.

**Research Environment:** At the Chen Lab, we foster an environment that promotes research freedom, self-motivation, and collaboration. We prioritize the diverse career goals of our lab members. The Lab is physically located in the Boston Children’s Hospital and academically affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Our location further offers proximity to multiple prestigious biomedical institutes, including the Dana-Farber Cancer Center, Massachusetts General Hospital, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The city also boasts a thriving high-tech industry.

**Life in Boston:**
Boston consistently ranks as one of the Best Places to Live according to the U.S. News & World Report. This vibrant city is renowned for its safety, efficient public transportation system, rich historical and cultural heritage, world-class education and research institutions, and its natural beauty, including ocean beaches, islands, rivers, hills, and mountains that showcase the allure of all four seasons.

**Commitment to Diversity:**
We are dedicated to cultivating a diverse and inclusive workplace. We strongly encourage individuals from diverse backgrounds to apply. We do not discriminate based on race, gender identity, color, religion, age, disability, or national origin.

**Commitment to Integrity:**
The Lab has zero tolerance to research fraud. Candidate committed to fabrication, falsification, plagiarism or deception would not like to apply for the position in our lab.

**Salary Range:**
The salary for this position ranges from $65,000 to $76,000, commensurate with experience.

**How to Apply:**
If you are interested in this position, please submit your curriculum vitae (CV), a cover letter (or research statement), and the contact information of three referees to kaifu.chen@childrens.harvard.edu.
